install dependencies:
php -v >= 5.3.0

perl plugins: (cpanminus is the apt-get for perl plugins):
- DateTime (http://search.cpan.org/~drolsky/DateTime-1.06/lib/DateTime.pm )
- StringUtils http://search.cpan.org/~miko/String-Util-1.21/lib/String/Util.pm

Commands I ran to get the perl modules:
sudo apt-get install cpanminus
sudo cpanm  DateTime
sudo cpanm String::Util


copy dest.pm to nfsen/plugins/
copy dest.php to the location of nfsen.php/../plugins/
vim etc/nfsen.conf
	- search for 'plugins'
	- Add a new line looking like this:
		     [ '*',     'dest' ],
	- save and exit the file
sudo service nfsen reload
You have two options at this point:
- just wait two plugin cycles for the plugin to be active
- run the following command two times, one after another
	/data/nfsen/bin/testPlugin -p dest -P live -t 201401031100
	- The time slot at the end of the command just needs to be a valid timeslot. doesn't matter when
- check /var/log/messages - the plugin will report that it is good to go 
	(if the plugin is active, it will print this every 5 minutes)
